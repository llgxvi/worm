Clear buffer in user space
before `copy_to_user()` again,
it doesn't append `\0`,
if the last copy is longer,
extra characters will appear at the end.
Solution `memset(buf, '\0', sizeof(buf))`

### copy from user
https://www.kernel.org/doc/htmldocs/kernel-api/API---copy-from-user.html

`copy_from_user()` doesn't append `\0`

### other
`printk()` must have `\n` for guaranteed showing with `dmesg`
